# Sports and Education Funding Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between funding for sports programs and the academic performance of universities in the United States. The dataset contains information about various universities, including financial data, sports budgets, and (if available) university rankings.

The goal is to identify patterns and correlations that may exist between the financial investment in sports and academic success, university rankings, or other factors.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **University**: Name of the university.
- **Sports Budget**: The total funding allocated to the university's sports programs.
- **Academic Ranking**: (If available) The academic ranking of the university.
- **Total Enrollment**: Number of students enrolled.

## Planned Analysis
- Investigating the correlation between sports funding and academic performance (or ranking).
- Exploring how sports funding relates to student enrollment, graduation rates, and other institutional data.
- Potentially building a predictive model to determine how sports funding impacts academic success.
